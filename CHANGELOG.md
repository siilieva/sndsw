The software versioning scheme is vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH+DATE-comment, where
 - PATCH - quick bug fixes
 - MINOR - new classes or functionality, updates to adapt to new external packages
 - MAJOR - additions of the detectors, breaking changes - hopefully we won't have such
 - DATE - to ease communication and mimic our CVMFS releases
 - comment - a short description of changes if available
 - e.g. v1.0.0+2025-07-updateScifi


The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
There could be several types of changes:
- `Added` for new features.
- `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
- `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features.
- `Removed` for now removed features.
- `Fixed` for any bug fixes.
- `Security` in case of vulnerabilities.

We start with the first sndsw release: v1.0.0+2025-07-updateScifi.
Shall there be a strong will/need, one can go back and create and
fill in the logs for previous stacks.
